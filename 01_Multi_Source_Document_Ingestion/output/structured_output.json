Also, \nthe purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided.     \n1.1 Purpose \nThe purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Amazing \nLunch Indicator” (ALI) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the \ndevelopment of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other \nexternal applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval \nand a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team. \n1.2 Scope \nThe “Amazing Lunch Indicator” is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest \nrestaurants based on the user’s current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and \nmore. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar \nservices.  \nRestaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web-portal. This information will act \nas the bases for the search results displayed to the user. An administrator also uses the web-portal in order \nto administer the system and keep the information accurate. The administrator can, for instance, verify \nrestaurant owners and manage user information.  \nFurthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system \ninformation is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server. The software also interacts \nwith the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user’s \nmobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated \nto them. The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information \nabout the restaurants. \n1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations \nTerm \nDefinition \nUser \nSomeone who interacts with the mobile phone application \nAdmin/Administrator System administrator who is given specific permission for managing and \ncontrolling the system \nRestaurant Owner \nSomeone who has a restaurant and wants his restaurant to be a part the \napplication \nWeb-Portal \nA web application which present special facilities for restaurant owner \nTable 1 - Definitions \n"

      "content": "4 \n \n2. Overall description \nThis section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to \nshow how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also \ndescribe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each \ntype. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented. \n2.1 Product perspective \nThis system will consist of two parts: one mobile application and one web portal. The mobile application \nwill be used to find restaurants and view information about them while the web portal will be used for \nmanaging the information about the restaurants and the \nsystem as a whole.  \nThe mobile application will need to communicate to a GPS \napplication within the mobile phone, which in turn \ncommunicates with a physical GPS device to find the \nlocation of the user, see Figure 1. The GPS will provide the \nmobile application with locations of both the user and the \nrestaurants and the distance between them, but it will also \nprovide maps and the functionality to display the \napplication’s data on the map. The functionality provided \nby the GPS will be embedded into the application in order \nfor the user to be able to use the functions in the application \nin a seamlessly manner. \nSince this is a data-centric product it will need somewhere \nto store the data. For that, a database will be used. Both the \nmobile application and web portal will communicate with \nthe database, however in slightly different ways. The mobile \napplication will only use the database to get data while the \nweb portal will also add and modify data. All of the \ndatabase communication will go over the Internet. \nThe mobile application has some restrictions about the \nresource allocation. To avoid problems with overloading the operating system the application is only \nallowed to use 20 megabytes of memory while running the application. The maximum amount of hard \ndrive space is also 20 megabytes. \n2.2 Product functions \nWith the mobile application, the users will be able to search for restaurants. The result will be based on \nthe criteria the user inputs. There are several search criteria and it will be possible for the administrator of \nthe system to manage the options for those criteria that have that.  \nThe result of the search will be viewed either in a list view or in a map view, depending on what criteria \nincluded in the search. The list view will have one list item for each restaurant matching the search \ncriteria and show a small part of the restaurant information so the user can identify the restaurant. The \nFigure 1 - Block diagram \n"

      "content": "5 \n \nmap view will show each restaurant location as a pin on the map as well as the user’s own location. In \nboth views the users will be able to either select a restaurant as target destination or get information how \nto get there, or view the information of a specific restaurant. \nThe web portal will provide functionality to manage the system and the restaurant information. It will also \nprovide information about the system, for example show when there is a new update. \n2.3 User characteristics \nThere are three types of users that interact with the system: users of the mobile application, restaurant \nowners and administrators. Each of these three types of users has different use of the system so each of \nthem has their own requirements. \nThe mobile application users can only use the application to find a restaurant. This means that the user \nhave to be able to search for restaurants, choose a restaurant from that search and then navigate to it. In \norder for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple criteria the users can specify and all \nresults matches all of those. \nThe restaurant owners will not use the mobile application but the web portal instead. There they will \nmanage the information about their restaurant, for example a description of the restaurant, contact \ninformation and their menu.  \nThe administrators also only interact with the web portal. They are managing the overall system so there \nis no incorrect information within it. The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as \nwell as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners.  \n2.4 Constraints \nThe mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the \nmobile phone. Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most \nlikely not be the same for every one of them. Also, there may be a difference between what navigation \nfeatures each of them provide. \nThe Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application fetches data from the \ndatabase over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.  \nBoth the web portal and the mobile application will be constrained by the capacity of the database. Since \nthe database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor \nincrease the time it takes to fetch data. \n2.5 Assumptions and dependencies \nOne assumption about the product is that it will always be used on mobile phones that have enough \nperformance. If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for \nexample the users might have allocated them with other applications, there may be scenarios where the \napplication does not work as intended or even at all.  \nAnother assumption is that the GPS components in all phones work in the same way. If the phones have \ndifferent interfaces to the GPS, the application need to be specifically adjusted to each interface and that \n"

Those requirements are to be developed in the third release, see Appendix IV. \n \n \n"

It gives a detailed \ndescription of the system and all its features.  \n \n3.1 External interface Requirements \nThis section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a \ndescription of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the \nuser interface. \n3.1.1 User interfaces \nA first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, \nsee Figure 2. If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page. \nIf the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see the search page directly when the \napplication is opened, see Figure 3. Here the user chooses the type of search he/she wants to conduct. \nEvery user should have a profile page where they can edit their e-mail address, phone number and \npassword, see Figure 4. Also, the user can set the mobile application to his/her preferred language. The \n“P” icon shows where the user can click to navigate to his/her profile page. \nIn Figure 5, the list view for the results is shown. When a user searches by price, this view should be the \ndefault one. The sorting header allows the user to sort the results according to price, restaurant name, \ndistance, restaurant type and specific dish. Each result item includes information about the restaurants, a \nlink to the restaurant’s web-page and an information link, which provides a more detailed description of \nthe restaurant. There is also a filtering option, where the user can choose to filter the results by increasing \nor decreasing the price or distance range, see Figure 7.  \nIn the map view each restaurant is represented by a pin, see Figure 6. Next to every pin there is an \ninformation link which provides a more detailed description of the restaurant, as mentioned for the list \nview. The same filtering option, as for the list view, is included in the map view.   \nFigure 2 - Login page \nFigure 3 – Search page \nFigure 4 – Profile page \n"

An administrator should also be able to log in to the web-portal where he/she can administer \nthe system by for instance editing restaurant or user information.  \n3.1.2 Hardware interfaces \nSince neither the mobile application nor the web portal have any designated hardware, it does not have \nany direct hardware interfaces. The physical GPS is managed by the GPS application in the mobile phone \nand the hardware connection to the database server is managed by the underlying operating system on the \nmobile phone and the web server. \n3.1.3 Software interfaces \nThe mobile application communicates with the GPS application in order to get geographical information \nFigure 5 – List view \nFigure 6 – Map view \nFigure 8 – Web Portal \nFigure 7 – Filter menu \n"

The communication between the database and the web \nportal consists of operation concerning both reading and modifying the data, while the communication \nbetween the database and the mobile application consists of only reading operations. \n3.1.4 Communications interfaces \nThe communication between the different parts of the system is important since they depend on each \nother. However, in what way the communication is achieved is not important for the system and is \ntherefore handled by the underlying operating systems for both the mobile application and the web portal. \n3.2 Functional requirements \nThis section includes the requirements that specify all the fundamental actions of the software system. \n3.2.1 User Class 1 - The User  \n3.2.1.1 Functional requirement 1.1 \nID: FR1 \nTITLE: Download mobile application    \nDESC: A user should be able to download the mobile application through either an application store or \nsimilar service on the mobile phone.

Prioritization and Release Plan \n \nIn order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements \nshould be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed. This section discusses \nthe choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements \ncould look like. \n4.1 Choice of prioritization method \nWhen prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first. This was done with \na simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”. Based on \nthe elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a \nnumber was set for each requirement. The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the \nten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach. The results, which \nare red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements \nand five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value \napproach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II. \nThe remaining requirements were prioritized according to the “Five-Way Priority Scheme” as shown in \nAppendix III. This method was chosen since it gives the different stakeholders the same importance and \nhas an enough wide range for determining which requirement is more important than the other [3]. \nHowever, in this prioritization process, the development team was not included as a stakeholder since the \ndifferent features were not considered to be as important to them as for the other stakeholders.   \nOther methods for prioritization, such as the hundred-dollar test and the yes-no vote, were also \nconsidered. The hundred-dollar test is quite similar to the five-way priority scheme, since it also gives a \nwide range for ranking the requirements. However, it is more easily misused since someone could save all \ntheir money and put them on a requirement that they think is very important [3]. Others might not agree \nthat this requirement is important but it might still get the most votes since one person cared about it [3]. \nThe yes-no vote method might be fairly simple to carry out, however the range is too narrow. For \ninstance, if two requirements are not very important it would be hard to determine which of those \nrequirements that is more important than the other [3].   \nIn conclusion, weighing the disadvantages and advantages of these methods against each other lead us to \nchoose the five-way priority scheme. \n \n4.2 Release Plan \nThe requirements were divided into three releases based on the prioritization and their dependencies. The \nthree different releases were assembled so that each would work as a fully functional application.  \nIn the first release the requirements that build up the foundation of the application were included, together \nwith the most highly prioritized requirements and their dependencies. \n"

They are more suited to act as additional features that can contribute to making the \nsoftware product more attractive. \nThe third release includes the requirements that can be afforded to discard if the project gets delayed or \noverruns the budget.  \nFor further details about the release plan, see Appendix IV. \n \n \n \n \n"
