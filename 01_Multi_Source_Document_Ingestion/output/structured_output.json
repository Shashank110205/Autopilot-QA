Introduction  \n   \n1.1 Purpose   \nThe primary purpose of this Software Requirements Specification SRS) is to provide a comprehensive \nand unambiguous definition of the functional and non-functional requirements for the Todo List \nApplication with role-based authentication. This web-based application enables users to securely \nregister, authenticate, and manage personal tasks through create, read, update, and delete CRUD) \noperations, while supporting role-specific access controls for different user classes.  \nThis document ensures that all stakeholders, including developers, testers, project managers, and \nendusers, have a clear understanding of the system's expected behavior. By adhering to IEEE Std 830 \n1998 standards, it facilitates verification and validation processes, minimizes ambiguities, and serves \nas a contractual reference for system development. The SRS emphasizes secure task organization and \npersistence, allowing users to filter tasks by status and maintain productivity without data loss.  \nFurthermore, this specification delineates the boundaries of the system, focusing solely on the defined \nfeatures to prevent scope creep. It supports the development of a reliable, user-friendly application \nthat meets organizational needs for task management in a multi-user environment.  \n  \n1.2 Scope {#scope}  \nThe Todo List Application is a web-based system designed to support user registration, login with \nrolebased authentication (admin, super admin, user), and task management operations including \ncreation, editing, deletion, marking as complete/incomplete, filtering by status (all, active, completed), \nand clearing completed tasks. All task data persists in a MySQL database and is visible only to the \nauthenticated user or authorized roles.  \nThe scope explicitly excludes advanced features such as team collaboration, real-time notifications, \nmobile native applications, integration with external calendars, or advanced reporting. The system \nprovides responsive design for desktop and mobile web browsers but does not include dedicated \nmobile apps. Role-specific dashboards ensure that users see personal tasks, admins view all tasks, and \nsuper admins have full system oversight including user management.  \nThis application differentiates itself through its emphasis on secure, persistent storage and intuitive \nrolebased interfaces, making it suitable for individual and administrative task tracking  \nwithin small to medium-sized teams.  \n  \n1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations {#definitions}  \nCRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete – Fundamental operations for data manipulation. Dashboard:  \nRole-specific web page displaying tasks or management interfaces post-login.  \nRole-Based Access Control RBAC : Mechanism restricting system access based on user roles User, \nAdmin, Super Admin).  \n"

Section 1 introduces the document's purpose and \nstructure. Section 2 provides an overall description of the product. Section 3 details functional \nrequirements with precise inputs, behaviors, and outputs. Section 4 covers non- functional requirements. \nSections 5 7 explain supporting diagrams, including use case, workflow, and data flow diagrams. Each \nsection uses consistent numbering and formal language to ensure clarity and traceability for PDF export \nand stakeholder review.  \n  \n  \n2. Overall Description {#overall-description}  \n  \n2.1 Product Perspective {#product-perspective}  \nThe Todo List Application builds upon traditional task management tools by incorporating robust \nmultirole authentication using Passport.js and role-specific dashboards. Unlike basic todo lists that \nlack persistence or security, this system ensures tasks are securely stored in MySQL,  \naccessible only to authorized users. It positions itself as a secure, scalable web application for personal and \nadministrative task oversight.  \nFrom a market perspective, it addresses gaps in open-source todo apps by providing granular role \ncontrols: standard users manage personal tasks, admins oversee all tasks, and super admins handle \nuser lifecycle. This enhances productivity in environments requiring accountability without \nintroducing unnecessary complexity. The application evolves standard task managers into enterprise-\nready tools while maintaining simplicity.  \n  \n \n2.2 Product Functions {#product-functions}  \nThe core functions of the Todo List Application are strictly limited to those explicitly defined:  \n  \n"

Each function integrates with role-based views to ensure appropriate access \nlevels.  \n  \n \n2.3 User Classes and Characteristics {#user-classes}  \nThe system defines three distinct user classes, each with specific characteristics and access levels:  \n User: Basic end-users with low to moderate technical expertise. They perform personal task \nmanagement CRUD, filter, clear) via intuitive web interfaces. Access limited to own tasks; \ntypical users are non-technical individuals like managers or students using desktop or mobile \nbrowsers.  \n Admin: Moderately technical users responsible for oversight. They access all users' tasks, perform task \nmanagement, and view comprehensive dashboards. Suitable for team leads monitoring productivity.  \n Super Admin: Highly technical users with full system control. They manage users (implied through \nrolespecific branches), access all dashboards, and oversee the entire system. Intended for system \nadministrators.  \nAll users interact via standard web browsers, assuming basic familiarity with web navigation.  \n  \n \n2.4 Operating Environment {#operating-environment}  \nThe application operates in a client-server architecture:  \n  \n Client Side: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive UI, compatible with modern web \nbrowsers on desktops and mobiles.  \n Server Side: Node.js with Express.js framework handling backend logic.   \nDatabase: MySQL for persistent storage of users and tasks.  \n Deployment: Cloud platforms like Heroku, requiring stable internet connectivity.  \nThe environment supports concurrent access without platform-specific dependencies beyond web \nstandards.  \n  \n \n2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints {#constraints}  \n Mandatory technology stack: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Passport.js for authentication.   \nResponsive design using Bootstrap; no custom frameworks.  \n No external APIs or third-party services beyond the specified database.   \nWeb-only deployment; no native apps or desktop versions.  \n Compliance with IEEE SRS standards for documentation.  \nThese constraints ensure consistency, security, and ease of maintenance.  \n"

The diagram is \norganized into logical workflow zones, each representing a major functional stage of the system.  \n 1. User Authentication & Account Setup Flow \nThe workflow begins when the user accesses the Todo List Application. \n1. The system starts the application workflow. \n2. The system checks whether the user already has an account. \n3. If the user does not have an account: \n• \nThe user is directed to the Sign Up process. \n• \nA new user account is created and stored in the system. \n4. After account creation (or if the user already has an account), the user proceeds to Log In. \n5. The system validates the entered login credentials. \n6. If the credentials are invalid: \n• \nAn error message is displayed. \n• \nThe workflow terminates. \n7. If the credentials are valid: \n• \nThe user is successfully authenticated. \n• \nThe system proceeds to role identification. \nThis stage ensures that only authenticated users can access the application features. \n \n2. Role Identification and Access Routing \nOnce authentication is successful, the system determines the user’s role. \n1. The system identifies the authenticated user’s role as one of the following: \n• \nUser \n• \nAdmin \n• \nSuper Admin \n2. Based on the identified role: \n• \nThe user is redirected to the corresponding dashboard. \n• \nOnly role-specific actions are made available. \nThis decision point controls access and enforces role-based permissions throughout the system. \n \n3. Task Management Workflow (User Operations) \nWhen the user role is identified as User, the following workflow is executed: \n1. The User Dashboard is opened. \n2. The user can perform task-related operations: \n• \nCreate tasks \n• \nUpdate existing tasks \n• \nDelete tasks \n3. The user can: \n• \nMark tasks as Complete or Incomplete \n• \nFilter tasks (All / Active / Completed) \n• \nClear completed tasks \n4. All task changes are saved to the MySQL database. \n5. After each action: \n• \nThe system checks if the user wants to perform more actions. \n• \nIf yes, the workflow loops back to the dashboard. \n• \nIf no, the user logs out and the workflow ends. \nThis workflow enables users to fully manage their personal tasks. \n"

The admin can: \n• \nView all users’ tasks \n• \nEdit or delete any task in the system \n• \nActivate or deactivate user accounts \n3. All administrative changes are saved to the MySQL database. \n4. The system checks if more actions are required: \n• \nIf yes, the admin continues managing data. \n• \nIf no, the admin logs out and exits the system. \nThis workflow allows administrators to oversee users and maintain task integrity. \n \n5. System Management Workflow (Super Admin Actions) \nWhen the role is identified as Super Admin, system-level controls are enabled. \n1. The Super Admin Dashboard is opened. \n2. The super admin can perform advanced operations: \n• \nManage admin accounts \n• \nEdit or delete any task \n• \nConfigure system settings \n• \nView system logs \n3. All configuration and management updates are stored in the MySQL database. \n4. The system checks for additional actions: \n• \nIf yes, the workflow continues. \n• \nIf no, the super admin logs out and the workflow ends. \nThese actions are restricted to ensure system security and stability. \n \n6. Data Interaction and Persistence Flow \nThroughout all workflow paths: \n• \nUser data, task data, and system data are: \n• \nRetrieved from the MySQL database \n• \nModified based on user actions \n• \nSaved back to the database \n• \nEach operation follows a controlled sequence: \n• \nAction request → Validation → Database update → Confirmation \nThis guarantees data consistency and reliable system behavior. \n \n7. Workflow Completion and Logout \nThe workflow concludes when: \n• \nThe user, admin, or super admin chooses to log out. \n• \nThe system terminates the active session. \n• \nThe application reaches the End state. \nThis ensures secure session handling and proper termination of access. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
